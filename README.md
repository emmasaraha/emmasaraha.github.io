<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As Told by Memes is an online community where you can view the latest memes, as well as the classics. 
The website is designed to quench your thirst, whether that’s for laughing at the virus which-must-not-be-named, current politics, pop culture, or just that classic meme format you saw popping up on your Twitter feed recently. 


### Built With

* HTML & CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap


<!-- THE JOURNEY -->
## Mockups

We started with making our group mockup. After having an initial discussion, we went away and designed our own mockups matching the homepage brief we decided on.
We then returned for another group discussion, and made a frankenstein child out of our three mockups, to make one agreed final design, which you can check out here: [home-page mockup](https://app.moqups.com/79kiw13sJI/view/page/a9de4d023). 
We did not concentrate on colour themes to much at this stage, which we added along with our chocie of Google fonts at a much later stage in the project process.

We decided on a few pages and features we wanted to prioritise: 
* A home page.
  * A 'Surprise me!' button, that would use Javascript to take the user to a meme article at random.
  * A carousel for 'What's trending'.
  * A 'meme of the day' card.
  * A 'Meet the Makers' section, with links to our own 'websites (modified versions of our 'About Me' pages from Week 1 & 2)'.
* A library page, where the user could browser the types of memes/meme categories avaialable.
* An article template, that would have basic HTML and CSS files to allow us to simply modify the content. 

## The Teamwork

We divided up our workload as a team.
We all worked on the home page by splitting it up into our desired sections or features, and made our own personal pages. 

Ilhan created the ‘meme of the day’ card and the working template for the meme articles.
Denisa worked on the Library page, and the 'Meet the Makers' page.
Emma worked on the first third of the site, including the Javascript for the 'Surprise Me' button, as well as managing our repository with all our documents.

## The Challenges

The biggest challenge for Denisa and Ilhan were the carousels we had wanted to implement. 
This was quite a complicated feature to use in our first project, but we did somehow manage to make it work after rewriting the code a million times, looking for issues and debugging. 

Another challenge was putting all the files together and making it work as one cohesive site - dividing the work on the home page caused additional problems regarding our combined CSS, as we had used the same indicators in some places. 
This meant our home page no longer looked so good... It was at this point that Bootstrap became Emma's newest enemy. 
However, after quite a bit of further editing (and some major venting sessions through Slack and Google Hangouts), the issues were solved, and our home page was working again. 

In the future, we'd definitely re-think this style of working - we most likely used separate files for too long, and we suffered a bit near the end because of it!

## The Aftermath 

We did have to make some changes to our original ambitions and ideas for the site - the articles and category pages ultimately become one page, by making grouped memes on one article with a defined category of a 'meme' topic.

We also had to simplify our home page in the end, as the combination of Bootstrap and CSS was ruining our styling. In the end, we decided that given the library page already had a carousel (that finally worked, yay!), we would instead keep the cards that Ilhan and Denisa had worked so hard on, on the homepage.
