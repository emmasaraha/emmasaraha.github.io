      <h3>The Reese Witherspoon Challenge</h3>
      <p>We know this year has been a tough one. And Reese Witherspoon created a meme that showcases exactly that, with several celebrities and fans following suit once the meme went viral.</p>

      <p>Reese's meme was a collage of photos of different characters the star has played, matching a different month in 2020.</p>

      <p>We start off with the perky Ms Elle Woods in the beginning of the year, and slowly migrate to her more frazzled character in the hitchiking drama, Wild. We think she nailed the depiction of all our emotional states during 2020. </p>

      <h3>Tiger King</h3>
      <p>Hey all you cool cats and kittens! When Tiger King was released at the beginning of April this year, it was <em>everywhere</em>. Of course, the internet did what it does best, and immediately reacted with a wealth of various #TigerKing memes.</p>

      <p>A bit like the craziness of the show itself, the memes from Tiger King don't follow any particular format and can contain a little bit of everything. But even if we're still arguing about the disappearance of Carole Baskin's husband, Tiger King helped us cope with the first few weeks of lockdown boredom.</p>

      <h3>Sue Sylvester's Toxic Environment</h3>
      <p>The TV show Glee may well be over, but the memes keep on coming. However, the ever-excellent character of Sue Sylvester popped up recently as a new meme in 2020.</p>
      
      <p>The simple format has sparked some serious creativity: a screenshot of her saying “I’m going to create an environment so toxic” has been doing the rounds on Twitter, and created some excellent captions.</p>
